# EntropyPure's Dotfiles-EP

My personal Dotfiles-Repo for my Arch Hyprland environment.

Includes Hyprland dots as well as my application dots.

## Setup

These are my personal notes to help myself should I ever bork up my Arch so hard, I have to reinstall. Packages, setup steps etc.

### Required packages

You can use your preferred AUR helper.

```
yay -S 
```

### Chezmoi Setup

Install using pacman or yay:

```
yay -S chezmoi
```
